EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS WITH GLOBAL SHARK ATTACK DATA      			                                                                                     


•	Performed Data preprocessing by implementing Data standardization and PCA Transformation, K-NN algorithm for data imputation and implementing Exploratory Data Analysis on the processed data to determine the Injuries occurred in a region binned by time of the attack visually by plotting the observations



•	Preprocessing was done with Numpy, Pandas library and Data visualization using Seaborn and Matplotlib library
